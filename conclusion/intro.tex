The next generation of networks require formal foundations they reside upon to be able to handle high volatility of a network's topology.
Thus centralized control systems become more and more obsolete.
So we are glad to propose a solution that strikes the right balance between the necessity to control a system, the flexibility, and simplicity.

By this paper, we propose a new approach to solving load balancing problem through use of a combination of "relay race" and AHP algorithms.
The latter enables separation of strategic and tactic reasoning thus allowing the best-fit solutions to emerge, while the former, being indifferent to the topology of a system, takes care of its volatility aspect.
We also developed two extensible algorithm for both individual agents of a system (network nodes), and the coordinating entity that monitors the state of a network.
