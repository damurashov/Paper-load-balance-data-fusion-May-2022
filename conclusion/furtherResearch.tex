Here are the directions of this work's further development we would like to suggest.
The first one is creating an ontology of load balancing quality measures (or searching for an existing one that fits the purpose).
As we have stated before, the preference hierarchy we have proposed before (Figure \ref{fig:prefgraphLb}) only serves the immediate purpose of being an illustrative example.
Creating such an ontology would, in turn, enable creating a more generalized preference hierarchy graph.

Once an ontology is defined, finding good quality measures becomes the next step.
Our previous work \cite{murashov-2022} might serve as a starting point in this endeavour.
Some of measures used there might highlight some good solutions, on conceptual level at least.
