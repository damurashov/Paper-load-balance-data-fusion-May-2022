    Apart from the increased amount of data being transferred, modern networks are characterized by high volatility of their topology.
    This is one of the reasons why conventional architectural approaches and technologies are now constantly subjected to series of modifications the most crucial of which is caused by the necessity for decentralized operation.
    There exists a good portion of algorithms which enable exactly that: load balancing in a decentralized network with changing topology.
    However, only a few of those optimize against multiple objectives, much less enable subjecting a network to coordination.
    In this paper, we propose an approach that enables setting of multiple objectives for load balancing process in a way so it only requires a coordinating entity to operate with strategic-level terms.
    Decisions made on this level fuse into local-level decision making performed by individual agents (network nodes), thus enabling separation of responsibilities in terms of scope thus allowing to fit the process of load balancing taking state of the network's partcular parts into consideration.
