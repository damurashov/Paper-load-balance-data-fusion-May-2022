In \cite{murashov-2022}, an agent would receive an input comprising preference hierarchy graph with pre-defined weights, the task itself, and meta-information regarding required technical capabilities a runner must possess.
Then it would compare its own state with that of its neighbours, assess those in the context of criterion used by the cluster, and make a pass-or-keep decision.
The set of those criterion consists of performance metric, energy efficiency, and load distribution uniformity.

Since the goal here is to achieve separation of local and global decision making, this preference hierarchy must be extended by additional levels.
