Now that we established the basic principles of how gain and loss get counted, and devised ourselves a preference
hierarchy, let us delve into topic of how a situation can be assessed locally by an individual agent. This of course can
be considered redundant given that the mechanism itself is the object of interest here. But having this full-fledged
% TODO: Is that correct to call it "proof of concept"?
model we will be able to run a simulation and see how the mechanism performs, thus get ourselves a proof of concept.

In essence, what is required to be done here is to model a way how an agent assesses the impact of its "hit", "run",
"gather", or "idle" actions in terms of "enemy resource deprivation", "resource acquisition", and other contexts (Figure
\ref{fig:df-models}).
