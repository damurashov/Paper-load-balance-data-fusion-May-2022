%TODO: the fact that we we do not use tree structure violates "the lore". I have never seen AHP algorithms that would be
%implemented in this way.

%TODO: MAYBE: I have managed to formulate formal requirements for the graph that we use. What
%if I write them as well? I define there a notion of level (to some extent), and reveal constraints that make the
%recursive approach applicable.
