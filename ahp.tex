%TODO: the fact that we we do not use tree structure violates "the lore". I have never seen AHP algorithms that would be
%implemented in this way.

%TODO: MAYBE: I have managed to formulate formal requirements for the graph that we use. What
%if I write them as well? I define there a notion of level (to some extent), and reveal constraints that make the
%recursive approach applicable.

%TODO: Constraints. We do not:
% 1. Delve into an agent's reasoning process;
% 2. Imply any particular structure of the graph;
% 3. Imply any particular implementation of an agent, neither its reasoning process (although we model that in our
%    "implementation" section)

% TODO: plan
% -- hierarchy of preferences
% -- definitions: levels, aspects, contexts
% ?? formal description of the graph
% -- fusion of tactical decisions up to the general objective
% -- using AHP for this
% -- the recursive algorithm implementing the idea
