Multi agents systems and comlexity that goes along can be a source of a great excitement. It is remarkable how a system
comprising a set of agent with very limited capabilities to reason and decision making produces outstandingly good
solutions to very difficult problems. From global economy to simulated ant colonies, small agents applying their best
judgement and acting in their own best interst get things done, sometimes as gracefully as no well organized and
well-financed think tank on the entire Earth could ever do. It has been known quite a long time ago that a beautiful
whirl of a seemingly chaotic swarm of mostly independent agents can make solutions emerge.

Have we had solutions just appear by themselves, this world would not be half as spectacular. Need for problems to be
solved and absense of low-hanging answers to our problems stimulate us to form structures and impose objectives on them,
and as for multi agent ones we have two ways to go. The first is to set agents up and let things happen. As appealing as
it is and as

effective as it can be, this approach does not always deliver the outcomes we want. The second one is to create a rigid
system of absolute control. When creating a PID controller for a thermostat, this is exactly what we want. But for
bigger systems, this approach may fall due to lack of flexibility, and in systems involving people, it
does so with dire consequences.

The advantage of the option in between those two extremes is arguably the flexibility it has. We can roughly delineate
two aspects in the process of that flexible group decision making: strategic and tactic. The first one is all about
so-called "big picture". Some entity that is entitled to establish the direction of the group's strategy, given that it
has all the necessary information, can reason in bigger-scale terms and define the general course of action for the
entire group. However, it cannot (and should not) see all the details of the strategy's particular implementation
instances. It is better to delegate this part of decision making to smaller groups or individual agents. There is no
one-size-fits-all solutions in systems comprising multiple entities, and some are better made in an ad-hoc manner.
% TODO: "some" what?
Situational awareness of individual agents may and often does possesses very valuable information that sure should be
considered before a decision is made.

The question is how do we reconcile the necessity to adhere to the global strategy, and yet at the same do not make the
system so rigid so individual agents become unable to apply the best of their situational awareness to make the best
solution possible within the confinements of the general strategy that is defined. How do we translate our general
objectives into individual agents' decision making process?
