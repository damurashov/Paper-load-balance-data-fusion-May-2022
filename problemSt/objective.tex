% An algorithm
By this work, we aim to develop a load balancing algorithm achieving two objectives.
The developed algorithm should enable a coordinating entity to set strategic objectives of the load-balancing algorithm using high-level terms, such as "efficiency", or "performance", while leaving details to be decided upon to agents (nodes).
Second, the algorithm must be indifferent to the network's topology or current state. It will enable altering the direction of the load balancing process "on-the-fly", on one hand, and make the algorithm resilient to changes in network topology, on the other.

% A network
Thus, we consider semi-decentralized heterogenous networks with changing topology. "Semi", because of the presence of a coordinating entity.
