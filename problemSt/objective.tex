% An algorithm
By this work, we aim to develop a load balancing algorithm achieving two objectives.
The developed algorithm should enable a coordinating entity to set strategic objectives of the load-balancing algorithm using high-level terms, such as "efficiency", or "performance", while leaving details to be decided upon to agents (nodes).
Second, the algorithm must be indifferent to the network's topology or current state. It will enable to alter the direction of the load balancing process "on-the-fly", on one hand, and make the algorithm resilient to changes in network topology, on the other.

% A network
Thus, we consider heterogenous networks with changing topology. A network of that sort is semi-decentralized due to the presence of the coordinating entity.
