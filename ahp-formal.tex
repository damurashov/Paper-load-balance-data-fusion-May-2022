After the generic description and the main idea of the approach have been explained, let us suggest the algorithm for
assessing the alternatives $\fnmalts$ in the context of node $\fnmroot$. And we start with laying out some definitions,
constraints, and inputs most of which are intuitive but should be stated nonetheless.

\begin{itemize}
    % TODO: context
    \item Local graph is a weighted oriented graph;
    \item It has exactly one vertex without a parent (root); it also has vertices without children (alternatives);
    \item For any 2 edges $(a,b)$, $(a,c)$, there exist no paths between $b$ and $c$ (so the local
        graph can be divided into \textit{levels});
    \item A node's \textit{level} is the max. number of edges that should be traversed from the root $\fnmroot$ to
        achieve this node, or one of its peers;
    \item There exists a path to any alternative from any node (so we can gradually build the
        resulting vector level-by-level);
\end{itemize}

Here are notations used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\fnmnode i j$ denotes node $j$ of level $i$;
    \item $\fnmwasp k {\fnmnode i j}$ denotes a weights vector representing assessment of all nodes of level
        $k$ in the context of node $\fnmnode i j$;
    \item $L_i$ denotes an index set for nodes of level $i$.
\end{itemize}

As an input, we have a preference graph (local graph) $\left< V, E, W \right>$ ($V$ - nodes, $E$ - edges, $W$ - weights)
having $N$ levels (it is assumed that $N>2$, otherwise the problem is trivial).
Weights for intermediate levels and the root are predefined, i.e. we have a set
$\fnmsetind
    {\fnmwasp{l}{\fnmnode{l-1}{i}}}
    {i \in L_{l-1}, l = \fnmrange{1}{N-1}}
$.

In the result, it is required to calculate $\fnmwasp N \fnmroot$ vector representing weights for actions adjusted for
strategic preferences, and assign an agent whatever action has the maximum weight. To achieve that we propose to use
\textit{AHP} algorithm which enables one to assess alternatives using preference weights of 2 intermediate levels:
%TODO: AHP, reference

\begin{equation}
    \fnmwasp a {\fnmnode {a-2} x} =
    \fnmAhp
        {\fnmSetWasp{a}{a-1}}
        {\fnmwasp {a-1} {\fnmnode {a-2} x}}.
\end{equation}

This property of the \textit{AHP} algorithm means that once lower-level weights (tactical assessment) have been
estimated, we can calculate vector $\fnmwasp N \fnmroot$ by iteratively assessing the alternatives in contexts of
vertices of levels $N-2$, $N-3$, and so on up to the root $\fnmroot$. It is possible since every alternative is
reachable from any node, so we can assess alternatives in any context.
